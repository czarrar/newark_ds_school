    ## Todays Class
    - Go through some demos on linear regression. Here are some questions to consider:
        - How can this linear regression be used to make predictions?
        - How does linear regression give us the best fit line? 
        - Where might linear regression do poorly? 
        - When should we use simpler models like linear regression versus more complex models that more accurately fit the data?
    - Overview of more 'complex' models like decision trees and neural networks. Discuss regression vs classification problems.
    - Go through some cool demos!
